This program was written by me during the summer of 2019 as part of an undergraduate research program funded by the National Science Foundation.
The purpose of this being listed is to demonstrate my ability to efficiently solve a problem by creating a program as well as to display my easy to read code and commenting.


My program was a crucial part of our research and resulted in the two papers listed below with the second paper being improved upon by my program's ability to automate the 
calculations, and provide us with even more data than could be calculcated by hand.

Generalizing p-goodness to ordered graphs. With Jeremy Alm, Patrick Bahls, and Kayla Coffey.
Submitted to Proceedings of the 51st Southeastern Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing.

Some Ordered Ramsey Numbers of Graphs on Four Vertices. With Jeremy Alm, Kayla Coffey, and Will Overman. Submitted to Australasian Journal of Combinatorics.
